# CareTransit Portal Development Guidelines

## Domain Usage
- Always use the public domain `https://caretransitportal.vercel.app` for production testing and user access
- Preview domains (e.g., `caretransitportal-*-jaysons-projects-daf93732.vercel.app`) should only be used for development/testing specific features

## Deployment Process
1. **Verify Changes**
   - Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
   - Ensure all tests pass locally
   - Review code changes

2. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "descriptive message"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   vercel deploy --prod --force
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check Vercel build logs for any errors
   - Visit https://caretransitportal.vercel.app to confirm changes
   - Run Playwright tests against production

## Testing Guidelines
- All Playwright tests should use the public domain
- Test files should be in the `tests/` directory
- Run tests in headless mode by default
- Always check Vercel build logs after deployment

## Error Handling
- Always fetch and analyze Vercel build logs when deployment fails
- Check for:
  - Prisma schema issues
  - Build command failures
  - Environment variable problems
  - Type errors

## Authentication Flow
- Public routes should be accessible without authentication
- Protected routes should redirect to `/auth/signin` with proper `callbackUrl`
- Test authentication flows using Playwright

## Cache Management
- Use `--force` flag with Vercel deployments to bypass cache
- Purge Vercel cache if needed through dashboard
- Verify changes are reflected immediately after deployment

## Code Organization
- Keep Playwright config in `playwright.config.ts`
- Store tests in `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names and comments
- Follow TypeScript best practices

## Test Files and Build Configuration
- Test files and configurations should be excluded from production builds
- Add test-related files to `.gitignore`:
  ```
  # Playwright
  playwright.config.ts
  tests/
  playwright-report/
  test-results/
  ```
- If test files are accidentally committed:
  1. Remove them from git tracking: `git rm --cached <file>`
  2. Add them to `.gitignore`
  3. If needed, remove from git history: `git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <file>' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all`
- Keep test dependencies in `devDependencies` only
- Never include test files in production builds
- Use `NODE_ENV=production` to ensure test files are excluded

## Best Practices
1. Always use public domain for production testing
2. Never hardcode preview domains in tests
3. Keep deployment process consistent
4. Monitor build logs for errors
5. Maintain clear commit messages
6. Run tests before deployment
7. Verify changes after deployment

## FAQ

### Q: How do I ensure the public domain is always up to date?
A: Follow the deployment process above, always use `--force`, and check Vercel build logs for errors. Purge cache if needed.

### Q: What should I do if a deployment fails?
A: Always fetch and analyze the Vercel build logs, check for Prisma, build, or environment errors, and fix them locally before redeploying.

### Q: Which domain should I use for testing and production?
A: Always use `https://caretransitportal.vercel.app` for production and end-to-end testing. Never use preview domains in tests or documentation.

### Q: How do I test authentication flows?
A: Use Playwright tests targeting the public domain. Ensure protected routes redirect to `/auth/signin` with the correct `callbackUrl`.

### Q: What should I do if test files are causing build failures?
A: Ensure test files are properly excluded from production builds by:
1. Adding them to `.gitignore`
2. Removing them from git tracking
3. If needed, removing them from git history
4. Keeping test dependencies in `devDependencies` only
